<p>For this story, I decided to take it mellow... wait, we're not doing a story this week?  What do you mean this wasn't Creative Writing 101?</p>
<p>No wonder I couldn't understand all the grammar and the new spellings and the new sentence structures - I thought I was going mad.</p>
<p>It really messed me up when I thought I was going to have to do outside research because I saw the word "library" for this week's assignment.</p>
<p>     Seriously, though, I would like to thank all of you for helping me out the best you could to undertand this gobbledy-gook known as javascript. I may be seriously messed up from now on, but it will be worth it when I finally earn my degree in 2015.</p>
